        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
          SLFA began as a grassroots initiative to provide young athletes with
          better opportunities in football. With limited resources but
          unstoppable ambition, local coaches and community leaders laid the
          foundation of what has now become a national development powerhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we run structured youth leagues, training camps, scouting
          events, and educational programs that help shape complete athletes
          prepared for life on and off the pitch.
